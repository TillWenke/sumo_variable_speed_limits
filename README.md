# SUMO Traffic Simulation
Project repository for Intelligent Transportation Systems course. 

## Scenarios
- Lane merging onto highway.

## Tasks
- [ ] Different types of vehicles and sizes. Using [Autobahn tutorial](https://sumo.dlr.de/docs/Tutorials/Autobahn.html). handling autobahn better via python (**Jure**)
- [ ] Traffic contraints that prevent cars to drive onto extra right lane. (**Robin**)
- [ ] algo approaches (**Daria**)
- [ ] Density measurements -> get along with metrics(**Till**)
- [ ] Visualisation of cars. Color of car depending on the inflow.


## Meet

On 21st Oct
- Jure took a look into "autobahn" = create a realistic traffic 
- Till tried to caputure metrics with inductive loop - but retrieving it via python is a little flawed
